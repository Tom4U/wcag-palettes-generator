# WCAG-Compliant Palette Generator

This small web app was inspired by an [article on Medium]() written by [Francis Wu](https://medium.com/@thisisfranciswu).

It generates color palettes using WCAG 2.1 compliant colors and setting the other colors by just changing brightness or alpha channel to a specific color contrast. All based on an initial seed color.

I extended Francis's approach in his article to generate complementary, analogous, and triad colors based on the seed color, delivering additional palettes.

This is a quick and dirty solution, and it's not perfect yet. Use it with caution, as colors may need to be manually adjusted, especially those that lower the alpha channel (subdued colors).

Some seed colors may work better than others.

I believe it's quite impressive, and anyone willing to improve it is welcome to do so. ðŸ˜„
